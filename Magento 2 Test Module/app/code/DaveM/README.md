This is a simple Magento 2 module I once did as a test.

It will add +/- buttons to the product quantity input (Knockout JS).
It will show a big border around the logo but only if logged in (layout handle use with an observer).
It also adds to command line commands: "greeting" (can be suffixed by a name) and "check-active" to see which modules are active.
